# compressible_euler_1d
To simulate one dimensional compressible Euler equations. There are input files for 10-12 test cases input folder and also exact solutions is available in output folder for comparison. There is a python scipt to plot results. 


How to run the code:

```
1. cmake -S src -B build
2. cd build
3. make
4. ./src
```

Output will be written to output folder. Just giving the output (result) file name in python script will plot and save the results in pdf format.
